# CircleFit



## Introduction

This is a simple game base on Collie.js.

You just need to press the space to make the pattern right in the black area.



## How to use

Import `circlefit.js`

Before using this javascript, make sure that you have imported the `collie.js` and get the div with name 'circlefit' and a input named 'score'.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://jindo.dev.naver.com/collie/deploy/collie.min.js"></script>
<div id="circlefit"></div>
<div align="center"><input type="text" id="score" readonly="readonly" ></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="circlefit.js"></script>
```

The game div is 500px width and 500px height.
